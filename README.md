# Edit Distances, Bigram Frequences and Transition Probabilities

This is a repository designed to house code written for a course in Language, Reading and the Brain. As part of this project, I aimed to compare Levenshtein edit distances with bigram frequencies and transition probabilities. Comments are welcome.
